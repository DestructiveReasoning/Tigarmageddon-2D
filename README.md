Tigarmageddon
-----------------

Tigarmageddon is a series of video games that I develop in my spare time, just for fun. The game is supposed to resemble Zombies games like "Boxhead", but instead of zombies, you must survive against an onslaught of tigers that are faster than you.

Tigarmageddon 2D is the second game in the series, and the latest one to date. The first game, Tigarmageddon, is a 3D first person shooter made with Unity. I felt like I was "cheating" by using Unity, so I decided to make the next game, Tigarmageddon 2D, without a game engine. I am using C++ mainly to get accustomed to the language (before I only knew Java) and I'm using SDL because I don't feel like memorizing code for making a window in Win32.

The game is being developed in Visual Studio 2012 Express Edition, but I plan on merging to Arch Linux and using vim. 

All graphics and animations in the game were designed by me as well, so I don't expect them to be all that great ;)

Please Note
---------------
This game is still under development, and is nowhere near complete. The code is not anywhere close to perfect.
Also, please note that a lot of code in this repository is not being used at all, for example, the Particle class. I was using it originally, but then I came up with a better way to handle things. Some useless code just hasn't been deleted yet, just in case I need it later, or just in case I want it for reference.
Furthermore, there are some useless function calls and if statements in the game loop in Main.cpp as well. Once again, I was using those functions before but not anymore.
