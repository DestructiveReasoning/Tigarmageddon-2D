Tigarmageddon
-----------------

Tigarmageddon is a series of video games that I develop in my spare time, just for fun. The game is supposed to resemble Zombies games like "Boxhead", but instead of zombies, you must survive against an onslaught of tigers that are faster than you.

Tigarmageddon 2D is the second game in the series, and the latest one to date. The first game, Tigarmageddon, is a 3D first person shooter made with Unity. I felt like I was "cheating" by using Unity, so I decided to make the next game, Tigarmageddon 2D, without a game engine. I am using C++ mainly to get accustomed to the language (before I only knew Java) and I'm using SDL because I don't feel like memorizing code for making a window in Win32.

The game is being developed in Visual Studio 2012 Express Edition, but I plan on merging to Arch Linux and using vim. 

Tigarmageddon 2D is still in development. I am in college now and I get way too much homework, so development is going very slowly for now. I am studying Pure and Applied Sciences, so we don't learn any computer science (makes sense, right?). Feel free to look over the code, and if you see any problems or ways to improve things such as efficiency, it would be greatly appreciated if you send me an email at harleyw@hotmail.com.

All graphics and animations in the game were designed by me as well, so I don't expect them to be all that great ;)
